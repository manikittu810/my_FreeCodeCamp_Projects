                <ul>
                    <li><b>1907</b>-Bhagat Singh was born on September 28</li>
                    <li><b>The Turning Point for Bhagat Singh:</b></li>
                    <li>The British government held the Simon Commission in 1928 to discuss autonomy for the Indians. But It was boycotted by
                    several political organizations because this commission did not include any Indian representative.</li> 
                    <li>Lala Lajpat Rai protested against the same and lead a procession and march towards the Lahore station. Police used the
                    Lathi charge to control the mob. Because of Lathi charge police brutally hit the protestors.</li>
                    <li>Lala Lajpat Rai got
                    seriously injured and he was hospitalized. After few weeks Lala Ji became shaheed.</li>
                    <li>This incident left Bhagat Singh enraged and therefore he planned to take revenge of Lala Jiâ€™s death. Hence, he killed
                    British police officer John P. Saunders soon after. Later he and his associates bombed the Central Legislative Assembly
                    in Delhi.</li>
                    <li>Police arrested them, and Bhagat Singh confessed his involvement in the incident.
                    During the trial period, Bhagat Singh led a hunger strike in the prison. He and his co-conspirators, Rajguru and Sukhdev
                    were executed on the 23rd of March 1931.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h5>Bhagat Singh was indeed a true patriot. Not only he fought for the freedom of the country but also he had no qualms
                    giving away his life in the event. His death brought high patriotic emotions throughout the country. His followers
                    considered him a martyr. We still remember him as Shaheed Bhagat Singh.</h5>
